# VIM - Because you are worth it

# Conventions

# Introduction
This book is intended for programmers, system administrators or writers
that use the tex language.

You have many choices when you start programming and the easy to start
is using and IDE. For example, if you are a Python programmer, you
may want to use Jetbrains Pycharm. That's an awesome product. 
Jetbrains will target each type of language with a separate IDE. It means
that if you want to switch from Python to Javascript, then you need another
IDE.

Vim is the master of all trades. Basically, you can use Vim to master all kinds
of tasks ranging from basic workflow edition for content writers,
advanced programming, network administration etc...

In some way, all modern IDEs will provide you with Docker integration, ssh
command line tools, shell window etc...

They just copy Vim and Emacs. That's why these tools are great. Demonstration done.
